This folder is designed to store a project's survey instruments. Usually, this means storing a copy of the XLS forms in which you have programmed the survey and which have been uploaded to the server. If your survey involves multiple forms, be sure they have names which clearly distinguish them. For example, "[PROJECT]_[ROUND]_HOUSEHOLD" and "[PROJECT]_[ROUND]_ADULT".
