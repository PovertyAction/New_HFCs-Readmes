Welcome to your new data collection folder!

You will find a read me file like this one in each indivdual folder to help you
navigate the structure.

Things to remember:

- Make sure this folder is integrated with your main project folder. For example, it could be called the "02_Data_Collection" sub-folder.

- Before populating this folder make sure to encrypt any sub-folders that will contain personally identifiable information.

- Preserve an organized folder structure by using consistent numbering and naming conventions any time you create a new sub-folder or file.
