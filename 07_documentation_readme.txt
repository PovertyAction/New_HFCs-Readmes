DOCUMENTATION
++++++++++++++++

This folder is designed to store any additional documentation about the HFCs process. Below are some suggestions of helpful documents to include:

- Explanation of protocols

Clearly describe the system in place for conducting HFCs. Who is responsible for maintaining the inputs sheet and the do files? Who is responsible for downloading data and running it through the checks? Who is responsible for reading the output and reporting out to the field when necessary? Having each responsibility assigned to an individual at the very start will ensure that data quality is taken seriously and conducted rigorously.

- Explanation of new checks

If any new checks are added, include a document that explains what they do and how they should be run.

- Data management log

Use this log to keep track of feedback given by the field team or whoever is primarily responsible for running the HFCs, as well as what was done to address issues that were flagged.
