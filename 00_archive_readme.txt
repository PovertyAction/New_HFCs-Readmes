 ARCHIVE FOLDER
++++++++++++++++

This folder is designed to store old versions of files and facilitate version control.
We recomend you save each file store here with a date in order to track old versions better.
For example "NAME_OF_FILE_08072018"

Add aditional sub-folders in order to organize files here.

You might also want to create individual "archive" folder inside each subfolder to facilitate 
sub categorization.
